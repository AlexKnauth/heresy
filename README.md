Heresy
======

Heresy is a BASIC-inspired pure-functional dialect of Lisp, currently implemented as a Racket library.

Basic Lisp primitives are provided, including a basic DEF MACRO, as well as BASIC-like control structures and definition syntax. The intention is to provide a dialect of Lisp with a more familiar BASIC-inspired naming scheme, for those coming from that school. It also serves as a playground for experimenting with how to program in a purely stateless environment, and exploring how traditional imperative control structures might otherwise prove useful in a stateless environment.

This has primarily also served as a learning exercise for practicing Racket macrology and thinking more functionally as a programmer.
